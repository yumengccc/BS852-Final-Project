# The association of grip strength with mortality

## Overview
This 8-year follow-up study mainly aims to examine the association of weak grip strength with mortality in a sample of elders (>69 years). The dataset has 2038 subjects in total.

## Methods
Descriptive statistics were computed using the proc means and proc freq to summarize subjects’ baseline characteristics. The hazard ratios and 95% CI for the association between weak grip strength and mortality using both the unadjusted and adjusted cox proportional hazards model. For unadjusted analysis, obtain the Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test for time to mortality, for those with and those without weak grip strength. The association between weak grip strength and other covariates were assessed using several simple logistic regression models. We also assessed the association of weak grip strength with mortality between gender groups by adding an interaction item ‘weak_grip*sex’. The confounding factors were examined using several cox proportional hazards models and 10% rules.
